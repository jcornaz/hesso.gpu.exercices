# GPU
This is the exercices of the GPU programming courses in the HES-SO (Switzerland).

## About the environment and the dependencies
There is many technologies involved (omp, cuda, many compilers, etc.), but the goal of the course is only to learn GPGPU programming. Therefore, the teacher provided a complete environment and code to use as an API. This environement configuration and the teacher API, cannot be included here.

For this reasons, there is no way to setup a running environment with nothing more than this repository.
